## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is provided by the Kaggle website and the original copy of the resources is from the book *Machine Learning with R* by Brett Lantz. Licensed by Database Contents License (DbCL).The dataset explains the medical insurance expense that effect by certain attributes. The attributes includes age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, and region. This dataset is really interesting as it also includes the region as part of consideration, the region difference might affect their living behaviours, living condition, weather difference, and taxation which create difference in the price. It is sampled within the USA with over 1000 people being surveyed. The dataset is basically for educational purposes, it is a good resource for the healthcare research as it relates the personal unique data with the healthcare expense. Also, this dataset is beneficial to the insurance company, which can use these data to measure different needs for each of their customers. In conclusion, we would like to use this dataset to identify what makes the price different when a certain attribute is changed.
